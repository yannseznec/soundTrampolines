# soundTrampolines
simple system for turning trampolines into sound


This project has:
- a Teensy/Arduino sketch for using a Teensy as a USB MIDI interface
- A PD patch for playing a sound library (the main patch is called _main.pd)

You'll need to use Teensyduino to load the sketch onto the Teensy
